about=geoCore creates a graphical representation of drilling profiles. The plugin depends on PyYAML (https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) and naturally on QGIS and thus PyQt. geoCore was developed in cooperation with the Lower Saxony Institute for Historical Coastal Research (NIhK). The NIhK provides the domain specific knowledge and is key driver for the plugin's feature set. Citation: G. Bette & M.
