# geoCore

## User interface

geoCore's user interface is kept very simple and should be self-explanatory. 

To show a drilling profile you simply select a drilling position on the map and click the geoCore icon (or choose the menu entry *Extensions* -> *geoCore* -> *Show drilling profile*. A dialog opens showing the drilling profile. 

Using the mouse wheel you can zoom in and out. The middle mouse button allows for panning. This is just like navigating the QGIS map.

A right click on the dialog opens the context menu which allows to export the profile as an image (supported formats are SVG, PNG, JPG). Furthermore you can rearrange the drilling profiles if you are showing multiple at once.
